# QuantumOS
An operating system project using C which runs console applications

Developed a custom operating system using C, focusing on efficient memory management and scheduling strategies. The system runs console applications and employs a first-fit strategy for memory allocation and a hybrid BSD scheduling approach, combining round-robin and multi-feedback queue techniques. This project involved designing and implementing core operating system functionalities, optimizing resource allocation, and ensuring stable and efficient process scheduling.
